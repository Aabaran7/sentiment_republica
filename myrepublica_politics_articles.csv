While addressing the ministerial meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement in New York on Monday, Rana requested the global community to take action for Joshi’s release. Minister Rana stated that Nepalis are eagerly awaiting Joshi's safe return. Last October, Hamas attacked Israel, killing many including 10 Nepalis and abducting Joshi. On the occasion, Minister Rana mentioned that the Nepal government has condemned the attack and has been demanding Joshi’s safe release. During her address, she also emphasized the need for collective efforts to establish peace in the world. She highlighted that wars, rebellions, and acts of violence continue to occur in various parts of the world under different names and pretexts, making it imperative for the global community to take collective action to end violence and establish peace. “I believe that conflicts have escalated in many parts of the world since World War II. Therefore, we stand at a very complex juncture in history, and it has become crucial to prioritize the protection of civilians from armed conflict,” she said. Minister Rana pointed out that despite continuous conflicts around the world, nations have failed to stop such wars, find solutions to the problems caused by these conflicts, and maintain peace and order among citizens. “We are now at the 75th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions, yet we are ignoring or misinterpreting the principles they embody for the protection of civilians. This situation must end soon, and we must all move forward with peaceful coexistence,” she said in her address. Foreign Minister Rana expressed that the death toll in Gaza is heartbreaking, and the suffering of civilians in the Russia-Ukraine war is similarly distressing. She called for an immediate halt to such violent actions and urged the finding of peaceful solutions to these problems. She stressed that such actions do not bring justice to anyone, and everyone should be aware of this fact. “Nepal condemns the killing of civilians, journalists, UN employees, health workers, and all ordinary citizens in Gaza, as well as the attacks on infrastructure,” she said, “The destruction of hospitals, private homes, schools, etc, has forced people to live in fear and terror, and such actions must be stopped immediately.” Minister Rana also requested the international community to seek constructive solutions to conflicts, whether between Israel and Palestine, Russia and Ukraine, or other similar situations, and to exert pressure to end violence.",Negative,Joshi,Bipin Joshi,2024-09-24 13:27:00

""Nepal's economic situation is not very weak. On the contrary, I see a lot of potential for its prosperity, which we will be able to achieve within a short time if we work hard,"" he said, adding, ""We are a rising democracy. We are also the neighbors of economic powers like India and China. In that sense, Nepal is in a position to become a multi-dimensional economy for economic development."" Saying that he was leading a government with two major parliamentary parties that had played a decisive role in Nepal's democratic movement, PM Oli said he had a resolution to maintain good governance and transparency. ""We have no other intention but to make Nepalis prosperous and happy. We are fully committed to the journey of prosperity,"" the PM shared. Addressing the 'Lead Free Future: Partnership Launch and Pledging Event' organized by USAID and UNICEF, PM Oli expressed solidarity with the lead-free campaign.

Despite being the duty of political parties and the government to introduce a civil service law, there has been little urgency. As a result, the civil service is struggling to manage federalism effectively. Experts in administration call it unfortunate that the civil service law has not been enacted, even nine years after the Constitution was promulgated. The government has been trying to introduce the Federal Civil Service Act since 2017. Previous governments tried to pass the law through ordinances when it seemed unlikely to get endorsed from Parliament, but both parliamentary and ordinance attempts failed. Most recently, during then-Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s tenure, the government registered the civil service bill in Parliament on March 4, 2024. On May 28, the bill was sent to the State Affairs Committee of Parliament. However, with the budget session of Parliament ending on September 16, the bill could not be passed. Although the government had pledged to pass it during the session, it will now wait until the winter session, with no certainty about its passage then. Kali Prasad Parajuli, spokesperson for the Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration (MoFAGA), emphasized that the absence of the civil service law has caused problems in mobilization of government employees, their career development, and transfers across all three levels of government. “The Federal Civil Service Act, an umbrella law, must be introduced soon,” Parajuli said. “Without it, mobilization of civil servants at both provincial and local levels is facing difficulties.” While the central government has completed employee adjustments at all three levels, challenges related to management, transfers, and career development persist due to the absence of the Federal Civil Service Act. MoFAGA employees reported that this gap complicates the relationship between central, provincial, and local governments. A draft of the Federal Civil Service Act was prepared after the 2017 general elections. Since then, multiple ministers and secretaries have promised to prioritize it, but none have succeeded in enacting it. This delay has hampered efforts to implement federalism through administrative reforms. Currently, the civil service operates under the outdated Civil Service Act of 1992, which was designed for a centralized governance system. The Constitution of Nepal mandates that the Federal Civil Service Act should guide the creation of employee administration laws at the provincial and local levels, but the lack of a central law has hindered provincial and local governments from crafting their own administrative laws. Despite six years of employee adjustments across all three levels of government, provincial and local governments still face severe staff shortages. Many ministries in Madhesh Province lack provincial secretaries, with lower-level employees filling in. Similar shortages are reported in Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces. Employees above the level of under-secretary outside Kathmandu rarely stay in their positions for more than six months while provincial secretaries and chief secretaries do not stay outside the valley for more than three months. Frustrated by this pattern, some provincial governments have proposed their own civil service laws to ensure that secretaries remain in their provinces, hoping to end the trend of officials preferring to stay in Kathmandu. Even after the promulgation of the 2015 Constitution, several commissions were formed to address how to reduce the number of higher-level employees, but their recommendations have gone unimplemented. In 2021, a task force led by former Prime Minister's Secretary Laxman Aryal reviewed the positions of secretaries and high-level officials. The task force recommended strengthening provincial and local governments and reducing the number of central government employees, suggesting a reduction of federal secretaries from 73 to 45. However, this recommendation is also unlikely to be implemented. According to MoFAGA, over the past 71 years, more than two dozen commissions, committees, and task forces have been established to address these issues. Some were chaired by the prime minister, yet their recommendations have consistently been ignored.",Negative,,,2024-09-20 10:20:00

In a meeting held at Singha Durbar on Thursday, the committee endorsed the names of 16 ambassadors by a majority vote, out of the 17 proposed candidates. Committee Chairperson Ishwari Devi Neupane announced that the decision was made after considering complaints from petitioners, the clarifications of the proposed ambassadors, their work plans, and their statements. The committee approved 16 ambassadors by majority vote. However, some documents related to the proposed ambassador for Sri Lanka, Ram Krishna Bhattarai, were found to be incomplete. Therefore, the committee has directed the secretariat to request additional documents. Neupane mentioned that Rastriya Swatantra Party lawmaker Dol Prasad Aryal expressed differing opinions on the proposed ambassadors for Israel, Prof Dhan Prasad Pandit; South Africa, Prof Dr Kapil Shrestha; and Malaysia, Dr Netra Prasad Timalsina. Likewise, Janata Samajwadi Party Nepal lawmaker Prakash Adhikari had differing views regarding the proposed ambassador to India, Shankar Sharma. In the case of Pandit, a legal matter is pending in the Supreme Court. Aryal argued that Shrestha cannot be appointed ambassador due to a constitutional provision prohibiting individuals who have served as members of the National Human Rights Commission from holding other government positions. In the case of Timalsina, he has filed a case in the Supreme Court against the government. Shrestha was a member of the National Human Rights Commission from 2057 BS to 2062 BS, while Pandit has been convicted by the Patan High Court. Regarding Sharma, concerns were raised about the guidelines for ambassadorial appointments, which prohibit consecutive terms. Sharma was appointed ambassador to India in Chaitra 2078 but was recalled before completing his tenure by the previous government. Of the four proposed ambassadors who have courted controversy, Sharma, Shrestha, and Pandit represent the Nepali Congress, while Timalsina is from the UML quota. Chitralekha Yadav has been recommended ambassador under the Madhesi woman quota and Sewa Lamsal from the Foreign Service. The cabinet meeting on Shrawan 14 (July 29) recommended new ambassadors for various countries. Dr Shankar Prasad Sharma was nominated for India, Kanta Rijal for Australia, and Naresh Bikram Dhakal for Saudi Arabia. Other recommendations included Prof Dr Kapil Man Shrestha for South Africa, Prof  Dhan Prasad Pandit for Israel, and Ram Krishna Bhattarai for Sri Lanka.

Previously, as the chief whip of the Nepali Congress (NC) in opposition, Lekhak had called for the committee's formation. Now, as the home minister, he is responsible for executing the report through the Ministry of Home Affairs. Once Parliament approves the report, it becomes enforceable by law, and the Ministry of Home Affairs must ensure its implementation. Ramesh Lekhak, known for his legal acumen, holds the trust of NC members. The NC, while in government, had set a precedent by investigating former home ministers and a deputy prime minister in the fake Bhutanese refugee scam. NC leader Balkrishna Khand was arrested during the tenure of NC Vice President Purna Bahadur Khadka as deputy prime minister. NC members are now pressing to uphold this precedent. Among those recommended for action by the committee, led by MP Surya Thapa, is former Chairman of Gorkha Media Network GB Rai, who is currently absconding. Meanwhile, Managing Director Rabi Lamichhane claims to have received a 'clean chit.' Although the report explicitly calls for action against him, Lamichhane, who chairs the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), has been creating public confusion with his 'clean chit' claim. If enough evidence is provided, Lamichhane could face charges of forgery, fraud, and misuse of cooperative funds, as per the committee's recommendations. On Tuesday, he reiterated that there is no evidence against him. RSP members and MPs are also downplaying the committee's findings, asserting that Lamichhane has been exonerated. Despite Lamichhane’s advocacy for good governance and anti-corruption, the committee's recommendation for action against him has placed him in a moral quandary. His insistence on receiving a 'clean chit' while confusing the public is seen as ethically questionable. GB Rai, also recommended for action, remains a fugitive, with an Interpol 'Diffusion Notice' issued against him. The committee has proposed seizing the personal assets of cooperative operators and other involved parties to compensate the victims. Political leaders have stressed that the home minister has no option but to act on the report. CPN-UML Central Committee Member Bishnu Rijal emphasized the need for swift implementation of the committee’s recommendations. ""The recommendations must be executed as stated. There should be no deviation, particularly regarding Rabi Lamichhane,"" he stated. The report suggests that if institutional assets fall short, personal assets should be used to make up for the loss. ""The movable and immovable assets of the operators, involved individuals, their family members, and others should be freezed. If necessary, immovable assets should be converted into movable assets to return the depositors' funds,"" the committee recommended. Due to the complete loss of funds invested in Gorkha Media Network, where Lamichhane was the managing director, legal provisions require the recovery of debts from the network's operators. As the committee has directed the government to prepare an inventory of assets linked to illegal cooperative activities, Lamichhane cannot distance himself from the matter. The committee's financial analysis of 40 cooperatives revealed that Rs 87 billion are at risk. NC central member Ajay Babu Siwakoti has also called for the implementation of the report. ""Ramesh Lekhak was very vocal in advocating for the committee's formation. We trust that he will present the report to the Cabinet and ensure its implementation. Any delays or attempts to obstruct the process will not be forgiven, not just by NC members, but by the public. I am confident the home minister will take immediate action,"" Siwakoti said, urging the government to take the issue seriously. On March 19, 2024, while serving as the NC’s chief whip, Lekhak called for the formation of a parliamentary committee for investigation. He warned that if the NC's demand was ignored, the party would continue to disrupt parliamentary proceedings. Consequently, the government formed the committee under MP Surya Thapa to investigate the cooperative fraud. With the same committee now having submitted its report, Lekhak is in a position to act. Advocate Radhika Khatiwada emphasized that Lekhak should take responsibility. ""The Home Ministry must act against all those implicated in cooperative fraud, not just in Lamichhane's case,"" she said, stressing that the report should be seen as a legal obligation. The committee has recommended establishing a Cooperative Authority within three months. Until then, the government should use the audit report for the fiscal year ending mi-July 2024 as a basis for regulating and supervising cooperatives with assets over NPR 500 million or those engaged in financial transactions, in line with amendments to the Cooperative Act, 2074 BS, and the Nepal Rastra Bank Act, 2058 BS. The Nepal Rastra Bank must ensure regulation and supervision under the latter act. The CPN (Maoist Center) has long advocated for the formation of the authority, and the committee appears to have addressed this demand.",Negative,Lekhak,Ramesh Lekhak,2024-09-19 11:15:00

After the Budget Session concluded on September 16, the parliamentary committees, often referred to as the mini parliaments, are expected to become more active. On Wednesday, only the meeting of the House of Representatives’ Finance Committee and the National Assembly’s Committee on Federalism Enablement and National Concerns was scheduled. There are 14 committees in both the House of Representatives and the National Assembly, with two joint committees comprising members of both houses. Primarily, the thematic committees, designated by ministries, are now expected to hold the government accountable on contemporary issues. These committees are tasked with monitoring the implementation of laws passed by parliament, overseeing black-market activities and the sale of adulterated food, inquiring about the work of the prime minister and ministers, and increasing surveillance on the government’s activities. In addition, the committees must continue the process of drafting laws. However, past experiences show that committees often face a lack of quorum, which hinders discussions when parliament is not in session. “If the committees fail to focus on the government’s activities when parliament is not in session, irregularities in the government cannot be investigated, and bad practices may increase,” said an official from the Parliament’s Secretariat. “There are significant national festivals like Dashain, Tihar, and Chhath, during which members of parliament are likely to return to their districts and may only come back to the capital after Chhath. Considering this, the Speaker and Chairperson must direct the committees to ensure that their work continues,” he added. According to him, parliamentary committees must function effectively by September, and after Dashain, their work is expected to resume from mid-October, following Tihar and Chhath. Members of parliament are expected to balance their duties between parliament and their constituencies. However, if they only focus on their constituencies at the expense of parliamentary work, the effectiveness of parliament will be compromised. As the winter session of parliament will only convene after December, if the parliamentary committees do not monitor, discuss, and oversee government activities during this time period, staff at the Parliament Secretariat will have nothing to do but routine administrative work, he noted. Parliamentary committees are the only bodies that can summon detailed documents of government activities. These documents are often made public through the media, which makes parliamentary committees an important institution in the democratic process.",Negative,,,2024-09-18 15:10:00

However, RSP’s officiating Spokesperson Manish Jha said that their decision not to allocate time for discussion was not intentional but due to a shortage of time. “We are still trying to allocate time, but it's challenging as we are short on time. Yesterday, the program lasted until 8 PM,” Jha said. “The Chairman’s report was discussed in the party’s central committee meeting and reviewed after suggestions.” The assembly includes around 1,500 delegates from the central committee, various bodies, departments, provincial party structures, and district and municipal-level committees.",Negative,Lamichhane,Rabi Lamichhane,2024-09-18 14:30:00

The report concluded that 40 cooperatives have embezzled a total of Rs 87 billion of their depositors’ money. The committee formed on May 28 also identified the involvement of four office bearers of Gorkha Media Network in the misappropriation of Rs 650 million received from a cooperative. Those implicated by the parliamentary committee include the chairman of the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) and former Managing Director of Gorkha Media Rabi Lamichhane, along with Chairman Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai; the company’s director Chhabilal Joshi; and partner Kumar Ramtel. The committee recommended government action against the individuals. After receiving the report from Chairman Thapa, Speaker Devraj Ghimire directed the parliament secretariat to submit the report to the government for implementation. With Speaker Ghimire’s instructions to the government to implement the recommendations made by the committee, it is yet to unfold how the government will take action. Spokesperson for the HoR, Ekram Giri, informed Republica that preparation to send the letter to the government for implementation is underway. “If it wasn’t for a public holiday today, the house would have sent the letter right away,” he said, “Under the circumstances, the house will now send the letter on Wednesday.” Upon receiving the letter from the house, the Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers will present it to the Cabinet for discussion and finalization. The Cabinet will then decide on directing the relevant line ministry, Giri added. According to Senior Advocate Tikaram Bhattarai, after discussion in the Cabinet, it will direct the Ministry of Home Affairs to proceed with further actions. “The Home Ministry will then instruct the police administration to conduct the investigation. The police may handle the investigation themselves or assign it to the CIB. The investigation by the police or CIB will determine what charges are necessary,” Bhattarai said, “After this, the matter will be discussed with the Attorney General’s office, and then the case will proceed to court. Only after following all the due processes can the matter proceed to court,” Bhattarai added. He mentioned that based on the nature of the incident, it appears that those recommended for disciplinary action will likely face charges related to cooperative fraud. These matters are explained under the Cooperative Act, 2074, he said. The report mentions that Gorkha Media, where Lamichhane was the MD, had obtained funds from Surya Darshan Savings and Credit Cooperative, Supreme Savings and Credit Cooperative, Sahara Chitwan Multipurpose Cooperative, Swarnalaxmi Multipurpose Cooperative, and Sano Paila Savings and Credit Cooperative. According to the report, Lamichhane has committed at least eight serious offenses including unlawfully deploying cooperative funds into the company, failing to inquire about or record the legal source of such a large amount of money, providing false information in audit reports, claiming non-existent sweat equity without any legal documentation. Similarly, the offenses include engaging in share transactions with fake transactions at the company registrar's office, leading the company into mismanagement, evading taxes through fraudulent transactions, and attempting to evade responsibility by claiming ignorance. The parliamentary committee reached this conclusion after conducting an investigation for three and a half months. Initially, the House had set a timeframe of three months, but on September 3, Chairman Thapa requested an additional 15-day extension, which the House approved.",Negative,,,2024-09-17 18:40:00

The ruling party CPN-UML, which had initially proposed removing Rana, citing her failure to maintain the decorum of her office, seems to have softened its stance. Mahesh Bartaula, Chief whip of UML’s parliamentary caucus, informed Republica that the removal effort is not currently on the agenda and accused the opposition of fabricating the issue. At a meeting of the ruling alliance held at Baluwatar on September 9, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli had proposed Rana's removal, which garnered the support of the coalition partners at the time. The following day’s meeting of the House of Representatives (HoR) saw a heated debate on Rana's removal. UML lawmakers called for her resignation on moral grounds, urging her to step down to pave way for a new deputy speaker while lawmakers from the major opposition parties Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) and CPN (Maoist Centre), not only opposed the move but also threatened to hit the street with protests if the ruling alliance proceeded with her ouster. Chief whip Bartaula clarified that the questions raised by UML leaders were not intended to oust Rana but rather to raise the issue at parliament. “Questions were raised in parliament about the Deputy Speaker's conduct being incompatible with her office,” he informed Republica, “The House will decide accordingly.” In a recent statement, Deputy Speaker Rana claimed that PM Oli has assured her that the issue has been settled. Speaking to a group of journalists after the meeting of the Constitutional Council (CC) on Friday, Deputy Speaker Rana said she had discussed the matter of her potential removal with the PM. “I brought up the issue, and the PM said, ‘You are a member of the CC. Let's not discuss market rumors. Let them stay in the market,’” she said. Rana also clarified that the letter in question had never reached the embassy, nor had the individuals traveled to the US. “In fact, the letter hasn't even been registered,” she added. Another key party in the ruling coalition, the Nepali Congress (NC), also appears to have withdrawn from the issue for now. On Wednesday, the NC had issued a whip instructing lawmakers not to leave the Kathmandu Valley, while those outside were directed to return to the capital as preparation for a possible motion to remove Rana. NC Chief whip Shyam Ghimire clarified that directing lawmakers is a common practice within the party. “With the parliament on the verge of adjournment, issuing directives to lawmakers is a normal procedure within the party,” he told Republica. Reports suggest that the proposal to remove Rana, initially made by PM Oli, was influenced by the NC, as the six-member CC does not include a member from the NC. The lack of a clear majority in the CC hampers the ruling coalition’s ability to make constitutional appointments. In the CC, PM Oli and Speaker of the HoR Devraj Ghimire hail from the UML, while National Assembly Chair Narayan Dahal and opposition leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal represent the Maoist Centre. Deputy Speaker Rana is an MP from the RSP, which is also in the opposition. The NC lacks representation in the council. It is also reported that the ruling alliance stepped back from removing Rana as some fringe parties indicated they would not support the removal proposal. According to the constitution, a removal proposal requires two-thirds majority (184 votes) of the 275-member parliament. Without the support of fringe parties like the Janamat Party, Loktantrik Samajwadi Party (LSP) Nepal, and Janata Samajwadi Party (JSP) Nepal, the ruling alliance cannot pass the proposal since the votes of NC and UML together total 167 (88 from NC and 79 from UML). The CK Raut led Janamat Party, an external supporter of the coalition with six seats in the House, did not respond positively to the removal proposal despite initially agreeing with Oli. Speaking to News Agency Nepal on Wednesday, Raut accused the government of trying to remove Rana with malicious intent. He claimed that the government’s goal was to secure a majority in the CC. Another external supporter of the ruling coalition, JSP Nepal, which holds five seats, remained neutral on the issue, stating they would decide if a formal motion for removal is introduced. However, JSP Nepal lawmaker Prakash Adhikari expressed his view that removing Rana would not foster a positive political culture. “The party has not made an official decision on this issue, but personally, I believe it is inappropriate,” he told Republica. He criticized the increasing trend of removing CC members to serve vested political interests. He also acknowledged that Rana made a mistake by misusing her power and failing to uphold the integrity of her position. Sarbendra Nath Shukla, a lawmaker of the LSP Nepal, argued that Rana did not commit a major crime by writing the letter for a visa interview. Shukla remarked that leaders from various parties are engaged in far worse activities than Rana. “This is nothing compared to the gold scandal, the Bhutanese refugee scandal, the 70-crore scandal, and the corruption in the COVID vaccine,” he told Republica, “She committed a wrong act, but it was not a blunder.” Other fringe parties, including the JSP and the Nagarik Unmukti Party, which hold seven and four seats respectively, have not yet issued public statements on whether they support the motion to oust Rana. Deputy Speaker Rana, who was nominated to parliament by the opposition RSP under the indigenous category, courted controversy after a letter dated February 26, 2023, was leaked in July. In the letter, she requested the US embassy to expedite the visa process for her entourage to the 67th session of the Commission on the Status of Women. Her letter sparked discussions in parliament and the broader political landscape.",Negative,Rana,Indira Rana,2024-09-17 08:15:00

The committee meeting, which continued late into the night, concluded that Lamichhane embezzled cooperative funds. ""All the evidence presented to the committee did not show him as innocent,"" a source stated. The committee has determined that Rabi Lamichhane, former Managing Director of Gorkha Media Network and a former home minister, and chairman of Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), along with the company's Chairman Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai, and Director Chhabilal Joshi, operated a joint account, disbursed salaries and allowances to employees from the cooperative, and filled out KYC forms at the bank, confirming their signatures on checks. Therefore, the committee has concluded that Lamichhane is not found innocent. ""He does not appear to be cleared of charges. It seems that the money from the cooperative was used to open Gorkha Media and pay salaries and allowances. There are no policies or regulations for using cooperative funds for media purposes. It is also evident that a joint account was operated in two banks,"" said a member of the committee. ""Despite what is said externally, there is no evidence of investment from sources other than the cooperative. The member also mentioned that funds were withdrawn using Lamichhane's signature. “Money was withdrawn through checks signed by Lamichhane,” the source added. During the 9-hour interrogation by the investigation committee, Lamichhane claimed that he was unaware of the investments, income, and expenses of Gorkha Media. Prior to leaving Gorkha Media, he had praised GB Rai, saying that one needs a heart like his. The audit report of the company's investments, loans, and assets also shows signatures of Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai as the chairman and Rabi Lamichhane as the managing director. Like Rai, Lamichhane had transferred the cooperative’s savings to the company, presenting it as his investment, and secured shares from the Company Registrar's Office on April 17, 2020. Lamichhane also mentioned in the documents submitted to the Company Registrar's Office, which include signatures and thumbprints, that he had invested money in the company for 15 percent of the shares. The committee's report was prepared by 2:30 AM. The meeting to finalize the report, which started at 10 AM on Friday, continued until 2:30 AM. Additionally, the meeting decided to send a written request for further investigation into the matter of Nepali Congress Vice-President Dhanraj Gurung. ""Although not mentioned in the terms of reference, the committee has determined that there is a need for investigation since a complaint was received, and a large amount of money is involved, with the Gurung couple being implicated,"" said a member of the committee. Sources claim that parliamentary committee members Shishir Khanal from RSP and Lekhnath Dahal from Maoist Center were trying to protect Lamichhane without naming him directly. ""It seemed that Lekhnath Dahal from Maoist Center was more inclined to protect him than Shishir Khanal from RSP,"" said a committee member. If the committee identifies the guilty parties and submits the report, Lamichhane will have to resign from his position and face investigation.

The ruling parties are preparing to either pressurize her into resigning or, if that fails, to remove her from the position with a two-thirds majority in the House. There has been growing criticism from the streets to parliament regarding Rana's failure to adhere to the decorum of her office. Deputy Speaker Rana, who was nominated to parliament by the opposition party, Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), under the indigenous category, courted controversy after a letter dated February 26, 2023, was leaked in July in which she requested the US embassy to expedite the visa process for her entourage to the 67th session of the Commission on the Status of Women. Rana has publicly admitted to writing a letter requesting a change in visa dates for certain individuals participating in the UN program, but she claimed on Friday that neither the letter had been registered nor the individuals in question ever reached the US. Nevertheless, the act of writing a letter to the embassy while holding the position of Deputy Speaker has led to criticism that she had failed to uphold the decorum of her position. This situation paints a picture of how high-ranking officials have been lax in their duties, prioritizing personal requests and interests over understanding their roles and limitations. To restore public faith and trust in democratic governance, it is often considered best for individuals in public office to resign when faced with serious accusations. Such a move not only restores public confidence but also holds public office holders accountable. In Nepal’s case of dwindling public confidence in political parties, such a resignation might also help restore the diminishing trust in parties. Currently, there is a debate over whether the ruling coalition is genuinely seeking to stabilize and strengthen the system. Many believe that past actions as well as current practices of the two parties in the coalition indicate that they are driven by self-interest rather than a genuine commitment to reform of the system and improvement in the conduct of politicians. In the days to come, what roles will the NC and the UML play, and how will they respond as letters from other leaders and officials come to light? On the one hand, many are questioning the ruling alliance's actions, while on the other, the ruling coalition seems to be focused on achieving a majority in the Constitutional Council (CC). As per Article 284 of the Constitution, the Council is chaired by the Prime Minister and includes the Chief Justice, the Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the HoR, the Chairperson of the National Assembly, and the leader of the opposition in the HoR. The CC makes recommendations for the appointment of the Chief Justice, heads of constitutional bodies, and other officials. Currently, the PM is in a minority within the CC under the present configuration. Prime Minister KP Oli and Speaker Devraj Ghimire were elected as MPs from the UML, while National Assembly Chair Narayan Dahal and opposition leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal were elected from the CPN (Maoist Center). Deputy Speaker Rana is an MP from the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP). Both the Maoist Center and the RSP are currently in the opposition. The Constitution provides that if a proposal to remove either the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker for not adhering to the office's conduct is passed by a two-thirds majority of the entire sitting membership of the HoR, the position can be declared vacant. Removing Rana is not a hard task for the ruling alliance as the ruling coalition commands 182 seats in the House, just two short of the required number for a two-thirds majority. On June 14, PM Oli secured 188 votes of confidence. Maintaining this majority would make it straightforward to remove Rana from her position as Deputy Speaker. However, if the removal of Rana is seen merely as a means to adjust the balance of power or stabilize the current coalition rather than to uphold constitutional norms, it could set a troubling precedent and weaken the federal democratic republic. Such accusations will start being leveled against key state institutions and their members based on parliamentary numbers and the interests of the ruling parties. The parties that are prepared to remove the Deputy Speaker today may use their majority to target the Speaker, the President, or anyone else tomorrow. There is a history of parliament becoming weakened when it acts impulsively and based on numbers. The impeachment motion against the then Chief Justice Sushila Karki was withdrawn by the lawmakers themselves. Similarly, the impeachment motion filed against another Chief Justice, Cholendra Shumsher Rana, has become moot following the change in the ruling coalition. The Parliamentary Hearing Committee raised questions about the educational qualifications of the then judge Deepak Raj Joshi, preventing him from becoming the Chief Justice. However, parliament and its committees have failed to investigate his credentials and bring the matter into the legal domain. The CC's recommendation of Krishna Man Pradhan for the position of Commissioner at the Election Commission was rejected by the Parliamentary Hearing Committee based on complaints. Additionally, no parliamentary committee or state body has deemed it necessary to investigate the allegations against Pradhan. After shifting power and interests, if individuals are targeted and then discarded by parliament and its committees, although immediate interests may be served, it will have long-term repercussions for the country’s governance system and structure. However, Deputy Speaker Rana's letter to the US Embassy in Kathmandu is not a trivial matter. Instead of merely using it to adjust the Constitutional Council's numerical balance, attention should be focused on investigating the issue and ensuring that such incidents do not occur in the future. Not only at the US Embassy in Kathmandu but also among many high-ranking and influential leaders, similar recommendation letters are likely to emerge one after another in the future. In such cases, if action is taken according to official responsibilities and legal frameworks, it will mark the beginning of reform, with action against Rana being a starting point. Otherwise, merely replacing one individual with another for the sake of immediate political interests will not strengthen the system; it will only change the situation without improving the system itself. Instead of strengthening the pillars of the federal democratic republic—such as parliament, the President, the judiciary, and constitutional bodies—using them for cheap popularity and political gain will weaken them. Creating controversies and manipulating these institutions for personal or party interests will undermine their integrity and effectiveness.",Negative,Rana,Indira Rana,2024-09-14 19:15:00
